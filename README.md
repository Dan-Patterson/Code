***Tools for ArcGIS Pro***


**Python Code Samples**

A repository for Python Code Samples, largely associated with ArcGIS software but some standalone applications.

Toolboxes are contained in separate folders.  Each folder has a scripts folder containing the scripts associated with the toolbox.

To use, all you need to do is download scripts folder and the toolbox and install in your working path or in a path accessible to all projects.


**field_calculator**

This folder is a collection of scripts which contain defs which can be used in other modules or specifically, they can be used in the field calculator in ArcGIS Pro or ArcMap.  The header contains useage information, and a python parser is assumed in all cases.  Check the respective help documentation on how to use the field calculator from within a table or the Calculate Field tool in Pro.
