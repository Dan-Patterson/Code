**PointTools**

Tools for working with point featureclasses.  Developed in ArcGIS PRO.
Most tools employ NumPy for their data processing.

*Notes*

- Download the zip file and unzip in a folder.
- Add the toolbox to your project.


The scripts can be examined here with downloading.

There are 3 toolsets:
 - Alter
 - Analysis
 - Creation

Some of these would normally require an Advanced license for ArcGIS Pro, however, the functionality can largely be replicated using python, numpy or scipy and arcpy.
